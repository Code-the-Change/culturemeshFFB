====================================
CultureMesh for Facebook Free Basics
====================================

CultureMesh FFB is mobile web site for CultureMesh designed for the
`Facebook Free Basics <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internet-org>`_ platform.

Because Facebook Free Basics strives to provide services to a very wide range of phones
and data plans, the mobile website needs to function properly without:

    1. **JavaScript**
    2. ``iframes``
    3. Video and large images
    4. Flash and Java applets

You can find more technical details about these requirements `here <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internet-org/>`_.

CultureMesh FFB started as a `Stanford Code the Change <https://codethechange.stanford.edu/>`_ project.

Developer Notes
====================

* We are currently using Python 3.6.1 to run the Flask app.
* This project along with the CultureMesh API, CultureMesh Android,
  and the original CultureMesh for web are all on `GitHub <https://github.com/culturemesh>`_.
