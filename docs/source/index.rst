====================================
CultureMesh for Facebook Free Basics
====================================

CultureMesh FFB is mobile web site for CultureMesh designed for the
`Facebook Free Basics <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internet-org>`_
platform -- you can also think of it as CultureMesh 'lite'.

Because Facebook Free Basics strives to provide services to a very wide
range of phones and data plans, the mobile website needs to function
properly without:

    1. **JavaScript**
    2. ``iframes``
    3. Video and large images
    4. Flash and Java applets

You can find more technical details about these
requirements `here <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internet-org/>`_.

CultureMesh FFB started as
a `Stanford Code the Change <https://codethechange.stanford.edu/>`_ project.
